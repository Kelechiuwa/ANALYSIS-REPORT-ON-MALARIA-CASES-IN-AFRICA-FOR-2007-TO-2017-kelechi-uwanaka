# ANALYSIS-REPORT-ON-MALARIA-CASES-IN-AFRICA-FOR-2007-TO-2017-kelechi-uwanaka
The design was done with Power BI, to analyze Malaria Cases in Africa from 2007 to 2017.  To achieve this design, I started by importing the malaria cases in Africa dataset into Power BI, where it was organized effectively. A variety of charts were used to visualize different aspects of the data:  
1. Line Charts were used to track trends, such as changes in malaria cases and incidence rates by year. This helped show patterns and highlight peaks or declines.

2. Bar and Column Charts were used to compare total malaria cases and incidence cases by country providing an easy way to assess which countries had the highest or lowest reported cases.

3. Pie Charts provided a visual breakdown of proportions, such as the percentage of children receiving antimalarial drugs, giving clear insights into these metrics.

4. Tree Maps helped to display hierarchical data, like country rankings by the percentage of people using safe sanitation services, offering a clear visualization of which countries are the largest in the use of safe sanitation services.

5. Line and scattered column charts were used to show the increase in incidence rate by the population of the country to highlight the country with the highest incidence of malaria cases (per 1000 population at risk)

Additionally, the charts were enhanced with formatting features like changing colors for better visual appeal, ensuring clarity, and making it easier to distinguish between different hierarchies. The slicer was added to allow users to interact with the dashboard by selecting specific countries, making it easier to focus on relevant data. By using line charts to compare different data points, such as malaria cases and incidence rates, a dynamic and interactive report was created to help identify key trends and patterns. The interactivity of the slicers also made the dashboard user-friendly and adaptable to different focus areas.

KEY INSIGHTS

Following my Analysis of the Malaria cases in Africa from 2007 to 2017, the following are my observations and findings.

1. The geometries of the malaria cases are 54 countries and it was observed that the total average of malaria reported cases is 1.07 million the average incidence cases of malaria (per 1000 population at risk) is 190.0% and the total percentage of urban population is 2.07k and the rural population is 33.42k which shows that the rural part of the geometries is more populated than the urban.

2. In the Total Malaria cases reported and Total Malaria Incidence (per 1000 Population at risk), it was observed that the increase in Malaria reported cases started in 2015 with about 92,968,526 million cases and went up to 128,146,255 million cases in 2017 which is the peak and the least cases for malaria is in 2007 with 10,102,341 million cases. The Malaria Incidence rate started high at 10,508.39 around 2007 and went down to 8,815.82 cases in 2017.

3. The number of children receiving antimalaria drugs by malaria cases reported shows that when there are 0 cases of malaria reported 13 children receive antimalaria drugs and when there are 44,518k, 839,581k, 7,37662 and 9,385,132 cases just one child is given antimalaria drugs respectively.

4. In the reported malaria cases by country it was observed that Congo, Dem republic has the highest number of malaria reported cases with a total of 77,556k followed by Mozambique with 43,984k, Burkina Faso at 41,602k, Uganda at 41,126k and Burundi at 40,250k as the least in the top 5 reported cases by country.

5. For the percentage of people using safe sanitation service by country, Tunisia tops the chart with 799.09%, followed by Egypt/Arab Rep. at 639.42%, then Morocco at 412.66%, Djibouti at 356.68% and Libya as the least with 296.29%.

6. In the Number of preventive malaria treatment in pregnancy by country, it was observed that Ghana is topping the charts as the country with the highest preventive treatment for malaria by 166, followed by Zambia at 147, Malawi at 101, Sierra Leone at 101 and the least being Senegal by 91.

7. In Incidence of malaria by (1000 population at risk) and average rural population by country, shows Burkina Faso is topping the chart with incidence cases (per 1000 population at risk) by 5,332.90, followed by Congo at 4,193.18, Mozambique at 4,140.56, Uganda at 3,709.15 and the least Incidence cases (per 1000 population at risk) is Burundi by 2,138.23 cases. The average Rural population of the listed country is 100.67%, 79.89%, 91.09%, 107.91%, and 120.45% respectively.

8. In Incidence of malaria by (1000 population at risk) and average Urban population by country, shows that Burkina Faso has the highest incidence cases (per 1000 population at risk) at 5,332.90, followed by Sierra Leone at 4,596.99, Central Africa Republic at 4,537.40, Benin at 4,514.47 and the least Incidence cases (per 1000 population at risk) is Cote D'Ivoire by 4,513.20 cases. While the average Urban population of the listed country is 113.08%, 20.10%, 20.02%, 22.38% and 24.42%

RECOMMENDATIONS

Here are some recommendations for each observation based on my analysis

1. Rural vs. Urban Population: Focus malaria prevention programs on rural areas since they have significantly larger populations and are more at risk.

2. Trend of Malaria Cases: Strengthen interventions in years with rising cases, especially from twenty fifteen to twenty seventeen. Identify what led to the decline in incidence rates over time to replicate the success.

3. Antimalarial Drug Distribution: Increase the distribution of antimalarial drugs where cases are high. Address disparities in drug access to ensure better treatment coverage.

4. Top Countries with Reported Cases: Allocate more resources to Congo, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Uganda, and Burundi as they contribute the highest cases.

5. Safe Sanitation Services: Expand access to safe sanitation services, especially in countries lagging like Libya, to reduce malaria breeding sites.

6. Preventive Treatment During Pregnancy: Prioritize malaria prevention during pregnancy, focusing on countries with lower treatment percentages like Senegal.

7. Rural Population and Incidence Rates: Tailor interventions in rural areas, especially for Burkina Faso and Congo, show high incidence rates despite significant rural populations.

8. Urban Population and Incidence Rates: Enhance urban malaria programs in countries like Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, which report high urban incidence rates.

9. Correlation Between Sanitation and Malaria Cases: Promote education and investment in sanitation infrastructure in high-incidence countries to reduce malaria breeding grounds, as seen in countries like Tunisia and Egypt with better sanitation rates.

10. Targeted Interventions by Year: Use historical trends (like the spike in cases in twenty fifteen to twenty seventeen) to predict and prepare for future outbreaks. Focus on enhancing surveillance and response systems during similar periods.
